# Interactive Genome Diagram Prototype

A couple of extremely basic prototypes I created in Bokeh (Python) and D3 (JS), originally intended as an extension of the Biopython GenomeDiagram module. 

Both viewers have tooltips displaying genbank feature informations and hyperlinks to the sequence on NCBI. The D3 viewer additionally can show crosslinks between genomes for visualizing orthologous sequences, for example.
